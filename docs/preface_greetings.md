Greetings Space Cadets!

Here we have the build guide for the RE-303 v1.2 (space cadet) it’s been a long road to get here but finally we have reached this milestone. We now have a working build which is comparable to the difficulty of building a x0xb0x.

Right I’m sure you are itching to get started but please read the next two pages. I’ve tried to make the build manual as easy as possible and some level of soldering competence is assumed. If you’ve never soldered before you should probably practise some before attempting this. There are some great soldering tutorials online if you search for them. I recommend you take a look at some if you’ve never soldered before, at least if only to learn some best practises.

If you fail one of the build tests, you should  never  proceed, it will only reduce the chances of a successful build. Try to figure out what went wrong, usually it’s only a misplaced part or something missed. Or ask nicely on the forums, someone will perhaps lend a hand.

I hope you enjoy building this machine as much as I have bringing it to you. Of course this could only really be a TB if Roland were involved. I asked them (I really did) but they turned it down in favour of something else. This is a shame as it would have been nice to work with a team rather than a one man effort which this has been. I’m sure it’s not perfect (it couldn’t be as I remade the boards manually by hand) but electrically it is correct which is the most important aspect.

The proof is in the sound, when you build it and play it for the first time, you’ll finally get what all that fuss was all about.

I have to send a big thank you to Guest, Altitude, Sunfl0wr, Herr Hewel, Sonic Potions and all of the Alpha builders who all contributed to getting the project this far.

Thanks again!

Paul
